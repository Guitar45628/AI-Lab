## Introduction
Welcome to the AI-Lab series! This README file serves as a comprehensive guide to the labs in this series. Each lab is designed to build your skills in AI, starting from the basics and moving to more advanced topics.

## Lab 1: Getting Started with NumPy and Pandas

In this lab, you will get familiar with **NumPy** and **Pandas**, two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The lab will introduce you to basic functionalities and how to use these libraries for handling data.

- **Objective**: Understand the fundamentals of NumPy and Pandas and how to apply them to data handling and analysis.
- **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of Python programming. âœ¨

### Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook linked below.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercises.
3. Execute the provided code examples to explore how NumPy and Pandas work.
4. Experiment with the code to better understand the libraries' functionalities.

### Key Concepts
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations, providing support for multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation, offering data structures like DataFrames for efficiently handling tabular data.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this lab, you should be comfortable with the basics of NumPy and Pandas and able to perform basic data manipulation and analysis tasks.
