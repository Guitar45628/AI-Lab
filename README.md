## Introduction
Welcome to the AI-Lab series! This README file serves as a comprehensive guide to the labs in this series. Each lab is designed to build your skills in AI, starting from the basics and moving to more advanced topics.

## Lab 1: Getting Started with NumPy and Pandas

In this lab, you will get familiar with **NumPy** and **Pandas**, two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The lab will introduce you to basic functionalities and how to use these libraries for handling data.

- **Objective**: Understand the fundamentals of NumPy and Pandas and how to apply them to data handling and analysis.
- **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of Python programming. âœ¨

### Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook linked below.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercises.
3. Execute the provided code examples to explore how NumPy and Pandas work.
4. Experiment with the code to better understand the libraries' functionalities.

### Key Concepts
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations, providing support for multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation, offering data structures like DataFrames for efficiently handling tabular data.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this lab, you should be comfortable with the basics of NumPy and Pandas and able to perform basic data manipulation and analysis tasks.

Feel free to explore the Colab notebook for interactive exercises and examples. Happy learning!

## Lab 2: Data Preprocessing Part I

In this lab, you will learn the basics of data preprocessing using Pandas. This includes creating DataFrames, splitting and merging data, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers and categorical data.

- **Objective**: Understand and apply basic data preprocessing techniques using Pandas to prepare data for analysis and modeling.
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of Lab 1 or basic knowledge of Pandas.

### Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook linked below.
2. Download and upload the required files (`IMI_Dataset.csv` and `dataset_missing_value.csv`) to the Colab environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercises, including data manipulation tasks such as filtering, merging, handling missing values, detecting outliers, and encoding categorical data.

### Key Concepts
- **DataFrame Creation**: Learn to create and manipulate DataFrames from various data sources.
- **Data Splitting and Merging**: Techniques for dividing and combining datasets.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Strategies to address and impute missing data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Methods to identify and handle outliers in your data.
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Converting categorical data into numerical formats for analysis.

### Files to Download
- [IMI_Dataset.csv](link-to-IMI_Dataset.csv)
- [dataset_missing_value.csv](link-to-dataset_missing_value.csv)

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this lab, you should be proficient in basic data preprocessing techniques and ready to apply these skills to prepare data for further analysis and modeling.
